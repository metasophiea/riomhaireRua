    Only 0 to 127 of the 256 possible values of a byte are in use, we already use code 128 to print the name of the machine; lets create a way of 
creating similar strings during runtime, of codes that can be printed to the console by just writing one of the unused codes. This will require the 
use of some of these codes and commands

128 : Select code number
    the next value entered after this, is the code we want to work with

129 : Clear
    clears the selected code of any string it currently has

130 : Clear All
    clears all the codes of strings

131 : Start of string
    indicates that we want to start writing a string to the selected code. All codes will be saved until the "End of string" code is written

132 : End of string
    indicates the end of writing a string

We should allow these pre made strings to print out other pre made strings (though perhaps with some recursion limit, or even block)
